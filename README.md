# Analysing Bank of America Customer Complaints data
## Project Type: cleaning/EDA → interactive visualization

Scope: Kaggle dataset from 2017–2023

Tools: Python (pandas, matplotlib/seaborn), Power BI

## Project overview
Bank of America (BoA), a U.S.-based financial institution, has amassed many customer complaints throughout the years. 
To tackle this, BoA has chosen to examine consumer grievances concerning its financial offerings from 2017 to 2023. 
A detailed dataset has been provided, which included up-to-date information about every complaint, such as submission 
and receipt dates, related products and issues, and the responses from BoA. The BoA invites analysts and policymakers
to examine the dataset to reveal insights and formulate strategies for responding to customer complaints more efficiently.

## Aim and Objectives
The primary aim of this report is to analyze the data, identify patterns, and propose informed, data-driven recommendations
that BoA can implement to effectively address and reduce customer complaints. 

## Data Methodology
The dataset was cleaned with python, duplicates were eliminated, null values were removed and  analysis were carried out with python using its libraries
A dashboard was prepared on Power BI, the wireframe was done with Figma.
